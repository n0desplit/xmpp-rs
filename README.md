What's this?
------------

A fork of the original xmpp-rs repo, which contains for the src for the xmpp-rs lib used to build XMPP applications.

Information from the developer
------------------------------

- `xmpp-rs` provides a high-level API for the protocol. You shouldn't need to
  know about the protocol to use it.

- `xmpp-parsers` parses XML into Rust and back.
- `minidom` is a DOM library quite specific for XMPP
- `jid` is a Jid parsing library.
